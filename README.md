Balanced for more intense and visceral combat - aim for the head. Much less predictable animations requiring better tactics.
-----------------

Instructions
-----------------
- Download the zip (https://github.com/tnutz/DIRiptide-DirectorsCut/archive/master.zip)
- Extract the data folder to My Documents\Riptide\
- For example, you should have My Documents\Riptide\data\inventory_special.scr

Features
-----------------
- Combat rebalanced to be deeper and more involved

- Headshots required

- Much less predictable animations for more engaging combat
 - Heavy weapons stagger better than lighter ones, but won't always do the heaviest animation
 - Walkers stay down for a shorter time, and randomly get up faster
  - Skills affecting knockout might actually be interesting now  

- Hits to a Walker’s arms break and dismember them easily, doing little damage but setting up a killshot
- Strong blunt attacks to the legs will up-end zombies

- Zero-stamina kick for defense
 - normal kicks are stronger against enemies you've maimed
 - An uninjured walker will shrug it off quickly
 - An armless or bleeding/shocked/burned zombie will often lose balance and fall
- Powerful jumpkick (John's special running kick is super-powered)

- More critical hits that make more use of special weapon effects

- Fist attacks and ground and pound are viable

- Gun headshots are deadly
 - shotguns easily knock down and dismember zombies
 - shots to the body can knock them down
 - bullets have penetration - can hit more than one zombie
 
- co-op experience gain is close to equalized
- Inventory size doubled
- Durability increased mildly

- Increased Field of View (80 degrees vertical from 62.5)

Issues
--------------
- Purna and Logan's Fury have reduced effectiveness because they don't target the head
- Fix is to tweak their fury skills to have instant death or other modifiers
